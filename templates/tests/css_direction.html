Setting up direction: rules is a pretty good idea for consistency and to make sure your content behaves the way you want it. Beware, however, that if your site has an alternate version for RTL, or if it has translations, or any user-generated content that may appear in right-to-left you will need to adjust these direction rules manually, or use an automatic tool like <a href="https://github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus">like CSSJanus</a>.
