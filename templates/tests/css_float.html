Floating elements are not really a problem, but they do expose a potential issue in case you have an alternative RTL version for your site. An element that is set to "float:left" will always be on the left side, regardless of the content directionality of the page. You will need to remember to flip those manually, or use an automatic tool <a href="https://github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus">like CSSJanus</a>. Be careful, though - There are cases of elements that should not flip directionality.
