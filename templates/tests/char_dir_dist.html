<p>If your site displays content of multiple directionalities, or if it has user-generated content that may be in a different directionality, you should pay extra attention to controlling the rendering of that content.</p>
<p>Depending where it appears, content of a different directionality may be rendered completely inappropriately or in a mangled way, unless you use Unicode BiDirectionality Algorithm's isolation and embedding rules. When to use each rule deserve a whole article of its own, but for now, you can read about it in <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-unicode-controls">Unicode's documentation</a>.</p>
