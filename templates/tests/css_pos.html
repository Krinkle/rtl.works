If you are planning to support right-to-left, beware of CSS rules that set explicit position attributes, like <em>left: 10px</em>. These will have to be reassessed for your right-to-left interface and, depending on their use, may need to be flipped. You can either do that manually for your right-to-left version or use an automatic tool like <a href="https://github.com/cssjanus/cssjanus">like CSSJanus</a>.
